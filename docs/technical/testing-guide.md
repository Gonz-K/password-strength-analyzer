# Testing Guide

Our testing approach combines comprehensive unit testing, integration testing, and security validation to ensure code quality and reliability. Through rigorous testing practices, we maintain a high level of code coverage and functionality verification.

## Testing Framework

The project's testing infrastructure leverages pytest for thorough code validation. Our framework encompasses multiple testing layers, from unit tests to integration tests, ensuring both functionality and security requirements are met.

## Test Coverage Results

Our password analyzer demonstrates exceptional test coverage, achieving 98% coverage across the codebase. The coverage analysis reveals the following insights about our test coverage:

The PasswordAnalyzer class shows strong test coverage across all major functions:
- __init__: Full coverage with 3 statements
- setup_patterns: Complete coverage of core pattern initialization
- analyze_password: 100% coverage of the main analysis workflow
- check_complexity: Full coverage of complexity validation
- check_patterns: Complete pattern detection coverage
- calculate_score: Thorough coverage of scoring algorithm
- generate_feedback: 93% coverage (15 statements, 1 missing)

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
Our unit test suite validates individual components through focused testing:

We verify password validation through multiple aspects, including length requirements, character composition rules, pattern detection mechanisms, and scoring algorithm accuracy. Each component undergoes isolated testing to ensure proper functionality.

### Integration Tests
Integration testing ensures all components work together seamlessly by validating:

The complete analysis pipeline processes passwords correctly, handling various scenarios from input validation through final feedback generation. We test error handling, security features, and API response formatting.

### Security Tests
Security-focused testing implements rigorous validation of critical security features:

We thoroughly test input validation, pattern detection accuracy, and common vulnerability identification. The test suite includes specific cases for attack vector resistance.

## Running Tests

Execute the test suite using these commands:

```bash
# Run complete test suite
pytest tests/

# Generate coverage report
pytest --cov=src tests/

# Generate detailed HTML coverage report
pytest --cov=src tests/ --cov-report=html
```

## Coverage Reports

The project maintains several coverage report formats for comprehensive analysis:

1. Terminal Output: Provides immediate feedback on overall coverage metrics, showing our 98% coverage rate.

2. HTML Report: Offers a detailed breakdown of coverage by function, highlighting:
   - Function-level coverage statistics
   - Line-by-line execution analysis
   - Areas requiring additional test coverage

3. Line Coverage Data: Detailed analysis showing execution data for each code line, helping identify specific areas for testing improvement.

## Adding New Tests

When contributing new tests to the project:

Write tests that maintain our high coverage standards. Document the purpose of each test case and ensure security considerations are addressed. Follow existing test patterns and maintain our established coverage requirements.

All new features or modifications should include corresponding tests to maintain or improve our current 98% coverage level. Pay special attention to security-critical functionality, ensuring comprehensive test coverage for these areas.
