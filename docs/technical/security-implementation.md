# Security Implementation Documentation

This document details the security features and implementation choices in the Password Strength Analyzer, following NIST SP 800-63B guidelines and OWASP security best practices.

## Security Features

### Password Analysis
Our implementation follows NIST guidelines for password security:
- Minimum length requirements
- Character complexity validation
- Pattern and sequence detection
- Common password detection

### Code Security
We maintain code security through:
- Regular security scanning with Bandit
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure error handling
- Protected against timing attacks

### Testing and Validation
Security testing includes:
- Vulnerability scanning
- Edge case testing
- Attack vector validation
- Regular security updates

## NIST Compliance

Our analyzer implements key NIST SP 800-63B requirements:
- Minimum 8-character password length
- Support for all printable ASCII characters
- Detection of commonly-used passwords
- Check for repeated or sequential characters

## Security Best Practices

The implementation follows security best practices:
- No password storage
- Local-only processing
- Secure error messages
- Protection against common attacks

## Security Scan Results

Regular security scans ensure code safety:
- Bandit scan results
- Vulnerability assessments
- Dependency checks
- Code quality metrics
