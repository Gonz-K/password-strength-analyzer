# Architecture Documentation

This document outlines the architectural design of the Password Strength Analyzer, explaining its components, design decisions, and implementation details.

## System Design

The Password Strength Analyzer follows a modular design pattern with clear separation of concerns. The architecture emphasizes security, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Core Components

### Password Analyzer Module
The central component implements NIST-compliant password analysis algorithms. It handles:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Character complexity analysis
- Pattern recognition
- Scoring calculations

### Testing Framework
Our comprehensive testing suite ensures reliability through:
- Unit tests for all core functions
- Integration tests for the complete analysis pipeline
- Security-focused test cases
- Edge case validation

### Security Layer
Security features are implemented at every level:
- Input validation
- Pattern matching for vulnerability detection
- Secure error handling
- Protection against common attack vectors

## Design Decisions

We chose Python for its robust security libraries and clear syntax. The modular design allows for easy updates to security rules and pattern detection without modifying core functionality.

## Future Extensibility

The architecture supports future enhancements such as:
- Additional security rule implementations
- Custom scoring algorithms
- Integration with authentication systems
- API endpoint implementation
