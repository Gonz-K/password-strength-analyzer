# API Documentation

This document details the Password Strength Analyzer's API implementation and usage guidelines. The analyzer provides a comprehensive password strength evaluation system based on NIST Special Publication 800-63B guidelines.

## Core Components

Our PasswordAnalyzer class serves as the main interface for password strength evaluation. It implements multiple layers of analysis including length validation, character complexity, pattern detection, and security scoring.

## API Methods

The primary method `analyze_password()` accepts a password string and returns a detailed analysis dictionary. This method performs comprehensive checks including character composition, common patterns, and potential vulnerabilities.

## Usage Examples

Developers can integrate the password analyzer into their applications using the following pattern:

```python
from password_analyzer import PasswordAnalyzer

analyzer = PasswordAnalyzer()
result = analyzer.analyze_password("ExampleP@ssw0rd")
```

## Response Format

The analyzer returns structured data including:
- Overall strength score
- Detailed complexity analysis
- Pattern detection results
- Actionable improvement suggestions

## Security Considerations

All password analysis is performed locally without external API calls or data storage, ensuring password confidentiality. The analyzer implements input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
